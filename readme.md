# SBURB: Incrementality Matrix
A tabletop game based on Homestuck, and also on idle games

___

## What?
Listen, nobody wants to spend hours resolving combat against individual imps. Most of what Homestuck was about was interpersonal relationships and building stuff, anyway. The important fights were *bossfights*; random encounters were just a way of getting grist. Behind the scenes, John and friends were slaying hundreds of imps and ogres by the end of the story, but that doesn't get any screentime--and even with a system where mooks die in one hit, that would mean resolving *hundreds* of attacks per combat encounter.

So, why not build a tabletop roleplaying game where the individual encounters just...don't get any screentime? *Incrementality Matrix* handles grist gathering the way an idle game might: your character's stats increase, that increases the amount of grist you can gather, you build new stuff with grist, rinse and repeat. Completing important objectives--fighting bosses, climbing your echeladder, building up to your first and second gates--increases your Alcheminsignia Rank, which enables you to pump more grist into any one piece of equipment. Accessing new Lands increases the variety of grist you have access to, which also increases how much grist you can pump into any given piece of equipment. More grist means bigger numbers on the equipment, which means you can gather more grist in the next cycle.
