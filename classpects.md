# Class Pairs
Each class is organized into pairs, each of which consists of an Active title and a Passive title. The details of what this means are complicated and not necessarily set in stone; this will be elaborated on in the description of each class. The short version is that the Active class is typically 'selfish', using its powers to directly affect itself, while the Passive class is 'selfless' and focuses more on empowering others or affecting others.

Classes are further defined by their role within the story, typically expressed in terms of their Aspect. It's important to note that, traditionally, a Class is assigned to whoever fits it the *least* at the start of the game. This is because SBURB wants you to have a character arc, and the best way it can do that is by giving you a class that you have to grow into or die. The GM will grant you Role Proficiency Points (RP Points) if you do things that play into your journey to become more like your class.

Finally, each class is grouped by which stat is its Primary Stat. Some calculations use your class's Primary Stat. **Classes that use Mastery as a Primary Stat cannot be obtained normally--they're reserved for special circumstances.**

| Grit                                            | Viscosity                                            | Moxie                                              | Scamperway                                     | Brainitude                                   | Pulchritude                                   | Mastery                                      |

## Grit Classes
### Boon/Bane - One who rains [aspect] upon others
The Boon and Bane are Classes which shower others with their aspect, bringing great destruction or mighty gifts.

The Boon is actually the *active* class of the pair, despite its tendency to give "gifts". The Boon's actual powerset revolves around manipulating others and building a structure underneath itself, using its aspect as a carrot to get other people to do its dirty work. A Boon player's gifts always serve two purposes--they're actually making a trade, setting up a partnership, or asking you to save their ass and sweetening the deal while they're at it. Strictly speaking, not all Boon players are rich-kid assholes; they generally want their actions to be mutually beneficial, and won't just order you around for no reason. That said, Boon players are the guys who are most likely to think that their powers can buy your loyalty--even if they didn't need to buy that loyalty in the first place.

For example: The Boon of Wands will offer their services as a tactician...but only because they can achieve some of their own goals while leading you into battle.

The Bane is a straightforward, simple class: It has a territory, and it will bring its aspect down upon whoever invades that territory. Of course, that 'territory' is usually the Bane's friends, which is what makes the Bane the passive class of this pair. Banes are that one 'friend' you have who's always bristly and grumpy and you don't really know why you hang out with them...until someone threatens you, and then they turn that bristly grumpy angry face up to 11 and direct *all* the rage--*ALL* of it--at whoever DARED to threaten *THEIR* friend. You will sometimes wonder if you're the Bane's friend, or just their favorite squishy. Either way, the Bane will have your back.

For example: the Bane of Life is the healer you always wish you had when doing raids in your favorite MMO. They're also the angriest, saltiest, most dangerous healer main you've ever met, so be thankful that they're busy shredding whatever you almost died to.

### Fiend/Heir - One who receives [aspect]
The Fiend and Heir are Classes which have their aspect bestowed upon them--the question being, is that a good thing?

The Fiend is the active class of the pair, and is *tempted* by their aspect. They could be very powerful if they accept this gift, but the end result is terrible destruction--Fiend abilities tend to be hard to aim, cause lots of AoE destruction, or otherwise have terrible costs. Usually the cost is something that someone *else* has to bear, but Fiend players are always personally affected by it--either because their conscience weighs on them, or because someone they care about got hurt. 

For example, a Fiend of Heart is constantly tempted by the ability to just...*fix* people. It would be *so convenient* to just reach into your Heart Thing and poke a few variables and just make you *better*.

The Heir is the passive class of this pair, and has their aspect *thrust upon them*. Power comes with responsibility, and the Heir is concerned with whether they can really handle that responsibility. Annoyingly, the Heir almost never deals with the same consequences that the Fiend does, because SBURB runs on vibes and storytelling; if the story has decided that you're the guy who angsts over whether it's the right choice, and then turns out to be actually a competent leader, then you'll always end up being a competent leader. That said, the Heir has an important role in doing the ectobiology that makes it possible for the players to exist outside of their reality, so maybe it's a good thing that Heirs almost never make mistakes.

For example, the Heir of Cloaks might stumble into a metaphorical Ring of Gyges, an exploit that breaks the game hard enough to permanently alter the structure of the session. If you feel like being particularly unimaginitive, or just feel like stealing from a shitty person, it might be a literal invisibility cloak. There'll be much hemming and hawing about the morality of using this item, and then it'll save everyone's life and suddenly everything's cool.

### Prince/Bard - One who concludes with [aspect]
The Prince and Bard both have to do with *ending the story*, and ending things in general. Their aspect is deeply tied to the end of an important chapter in the story.

The Prince--being the active member of this pair--is a heroic warrior, capable of slaying almighty foes with their aspect--but more importantly, they're also capable of slaying *the aspect itself*. The Prince is, inevitably, the one who strikes the final blow on their aspect--concluding an act of this demented stageplay with a decisive blow. Expect the Prince to be kind of upset about this. After all, they're usually intimately familiar with the aspect they just killed.

For example, a Prince of Cups will grow more and more powerful as they gain more and more stuff, but they'll eventually reach a point where greed *is* their opponent, and the only way to truly progress through the story is to kill greed itself--an act which will leave the Prince of Cups almost powerless, shaken to their core.

The Bard, as the passive member, works to end the story in the background--weaving their aspect into everything they touch, until it all comes together in a climactic moment that you never saw coming but always knew would happen. Bards will either singlehandedly save the entire session with a plan that only they understood, or singlehandedly doom the entire session by casually shattering everything you were working on. Bards are capital-F Fun (the 'F' stands for "fuck these guys").

For example, a Bard of Rage...well, you've probably read Homestuck, you know what happened in the session that had a Bard of Rage in it. (Spoilers: Everyone died.)

### Mask/Shield - One who covers with [aspect]
The Mask and the Shield are hyperfocused on infusing their aspect into either themselves or others. 

The Mask can put on their aspect like, well, a mask--becoming like their aspect, as long as they can keep up the charade. If you're not into theater or tokusatsu, this class might not click for you. It's important to remember that the Mask is wearing a *mask*--they aren't *really* their aspect, they just play it on TV. At some point, the mask has to come off.

For example, the Mask of Joy can become the embodiment of wacky hijinks, but they can't wear The Mask forever--not without suffering some serious Weird Identity Crisis Shit.

The Shield is a protector and defender, filling others with their aspect to shield them from harm. The Shield can't really defend themself--their powers are just *weaker* when self-targeted, which pairs 'nicely' with conditional immortality. A Shield player is particularly vulnerable to toxic selflessness--everyone else always comes first, even when it might kill the Shield.

For example, the Shield of Stone can suffuse other players with the raw immovability of a mountain, making them nearly impossible to kill.

## Viscosity Classes
### Knight/Page - One who wields [aspect]
The Knight and Page are both heavily focused on combat applications of their aspect.

Knights are typically the most powerful players in the starting phase of the game, particularly if they're able to use the Time aspect to access gear from a timeline that reached endgame without winning. They have the best direct access to their aspect, and are the most direct when using it. Simply put, there is no beating a Knight in an asskicking contest; they are simply the best there is...at first. Other classes scale better, as the Knight can only truly shine in one-on-one combat. Aspects such as Time or Fae that enable you to be in many places at once completely eliminate this downside...if you can stay coordinated. Make sure you keep a close eye on the Knight's emotional health, because they'll be too busy getting shit done to take care of themselves.

For example, a Knight of Blades has total, inalienable mastery over all aspects of physical battle. 

The Page is the opposite of the Knight--not only is the Page weaker than the Knight in direct combat at the start of the game, they're also typically *deficient* in their aspect, suffering from some debilitation or crippling flaw that makes them less effective. However, the Page is the single most powerful class in terms of how quickly it scales up--a Page who has achieved lategame status is capable of defeating even a Master Class. Pages are a real lifesaver, if you can keep them alive long enough. They're also generally wholesome people who don't deserve this kinda treatment.

For example, a Page of Coins would be saddled with some seriously unfair setbacks...and then they'll be able to reduce 50% of the enemy forces to dust in a snap of their fingers. Totally unbalanced, as all things should be.

### Dame/Guard - One who enshrines [aspect]
The Dame and the Guard are classes who hold their aspect in high regard, and use it as powerful armor.

The Dame is a bulwark whose aspect is the source of their incredible power. As an active class, their power affects them directly, but it typically comes from somewhere else--a place of power, a confidante, or some other thing outside of their control. Think of the Dame like a Cleric--they have to call upon their aspect's favor to make their powers work. Dames hold total confidence, only losing their cool on rare occasions when the sheer bullshittery is simply too much. Despite the name, the Dame class can actually be given to a character of any gender, because SBURB's devs are too incompetent to successfully enforce gender norms. Yay?

For example, a Dame of Flood might have a particularly impressive gymnasium somewhere on their Land, where they can go to commune with Flood through the power of MASSIVE GAINS, allowing them to manifest great feats of strength on the battlefield.

The Guard is a loyal ally who calls upon their aspect in a manner similar to the Dame, but always in service of some third party. The Dame will call upon their aspect so they can personally lay the beatdown on something; the Guard will call upon their aspect because someone in the party is about to get beaten down, and a beatdown reversal is in order. Guards will laugh boisterously and shout "WHAT HO, VILLAIN" and stuff. It's cheesy, but they take genuine joy in running to other people's aid. Even when it's a bad idea. Leroy Jenkins was probably a Guard.

For example, a Guard of Eyes will appear out of nowhere, surround a boss with illusory copies of themself, and then snap off a dumb one-liner as they carry an injured ally to safety. Some real shadow clone jutsu shit.

### King/Queen - One who is ordained by [aspect]
The King and Queen draw their power from their aspect, but in more of a predestination, "I am the incarnation of [aspect]'s will'" way.

Remember, classes in SBURB are gender-neutral even when it sounds like they aren't. Girls can be King of things, boys can be Queens, and non-binary eldritch genderfuck constructs can be...anything, really, that's kind of the point.

The King is basically an avatar of their aspect, becoming nearly indistinguishable from it at the end of their power scaling. They have a one-track mind--if it's in line with their aspect, it's a good idea; if it's not, they start getting nervous about it. They can still accept plans that require something that's against their aspect--they're not Lawful Stupid. They *will*, however, be complaining about it the entire time, particularly if the thing they're doing is "dishonorable".

For example, a King of Law will become hyper-focused on regulating and restricting things, using decrees and rules to guide all of their actions. And they'll throw a fit if your plan involves stealing anything. They'll be a total narc, even if they know this is the only path forward.

The Queen is more focused on maintaining a kingdom, bringing the will of their aspect through their actions by building the people around them up with it. Instead of embodying their aspect's will directly, the Queen seeks to build a world where their aspect is part of everyday life. A lot of aspects sound like they'd make *terrible* kingdoms, but the Queen inevitably finds a way to make it sound like a really cool idea. Queens are great at providing long-term buffs that become extremely powerful once the Queen has built the kingdom up enough.

For example, a Queen of Flux will extoll the virtues of making life more like it is in stories, seeking to create the fairytale land where everyone can live happily ever after.

### Strength/Scales - One who tempers [aspect]
Strength and Scales are all about using their aspect in moderation, or to moderate themselves.

Strength wants to focus inward on their aspect, becoming stronger by finding their aspect within. Strength players are at their best when they've made some important self-discovery, or when they've had a whole session of important self-discoveries all stacked on top of each other like some kind of metaphorical omniburger. Going 100% all the time isn't the best move for Strength--anybody who's done a workout knows that the correct amount varies from time to time. These guys specialize in the kind of crazy martial arts bullshit where they find the *one* strike that ends the entire fight, and just do that.

For example, the Strength of Sand will be at their most powerful when they have a thorough understanding of their own weaknesses, especially if they realize that the thing they're fighting has the exact same weakness.

Scales is all about achieving a perfect balance of one's aspect through finding it in the world. It's the class of temperance, always looking to have just the right amount of whatever their aspect represents, and always looking to show their allies the value of restraint. These are the traditional druid/monk type guys, who are always talking about inner peace, self-awareness, and tranquility. Even while they're beating the crap out of something. In fact, beating the crap out of something is usually a means of blowing off steam and realigning their inner balance, and if they invite you to participate, you'll feel a lot better after the fisticuffs jam session is over.

For example, the Scales of Void will seek to strike the perfect balance of minimalism--teaching the others how to meditate, so they can become one with nothing, so that the party can make their fists one with everything more easily.

## Moxie Classes
### Witch/Mage - One who mystifies with [aspect]
The Witch and the Mage are classes that focus on doing really crazy Weird Aspect Shit. They're spellcasters, basically, playing with or against the "rules" that mere mortals must play by.

The Witch is good at breaking the rules of their aspect. They're always looking for new and exciting ways to abuse their aspect, and as the active member of the pair, this translates into all kinds of wacky combat applications. They basically get to choose which (heh) parts of their aspect apply to them, and their role in the story will often involve choosing to nullify parts of their aspect at a key moment. They're goofy and weird, and self-consciousness is their kryptonite.

For example, the Witch of Bone can decide which parts of their legacy they're stuck with at any given moment, enhancing different elements of their lineage and destiny to become better at what they need to do right now.

The Mage is good at understanding the rules of their aspect. They're always finding caveats and edge cases, and as the passive member of the pair, this means they're really good at giving advice and keeping you out of trouble. They get to rules-lawyer their aspect, ensuring that enemies get hit with the full force of the aspect's consequences while shielding you from the worst harm, and their role in the story usually involves finding the loophole that makes their aspect come into play. They're sober and wise, and can't take a joke to save their life.

For example, the Mage of Ploy has a deep and powerful understanding of which conflicts will end in what ways. He has the most accurate power level ranking video essays. Don't get into a canon-explaining contest with that guy, he's simply the best there is.

### Smith/Sign - One who makes [aspect] anew
The Smith and the Sign are classes that have to do with adding new elements to the story, expanding the game. They're modders fixing a badly-designed open-world RPG. Say what you want about SBURB's creators, they understand the value of having a good modding community.

The Smith directly creates things from their aspect--and as the active class of the pair, it's usually so they can *personally* take advantage of it. Smiths hammer out entire new mechanics *just* so they can exploit those mechanics for great effect. They're also creating new parts of the *story*; a Smith will create their Aspect with great skill, in great quantities, or of incredible quality. A session with a Smith in it is going to have *something* non-standard happen as part of the plot.

For instance, a Smith of Doom probably spends their free time making doomsday devices--but more importantly, they'll engineer the plan that dooms a particularly strong foe, making the rest of the story possible by crafting the perfect death.

The Sign *reveals* their aspect in other things, most often in other players or in prophecies--and as the passive class of the pair, these revelations are usually for everyone's benefit. A Sign doesn't really *intend* to make big dramatic reveals; it just *happens*, usually right when it needs to. They tend to reveal really important details of the story, uncovering sinister plots or secrets relating to their aspect. A session with a Sign in it will involve a lot of deep and terrible secrets coming to light, and a lot of soul-searching and wrestling with the implications of those secrets.

For example, a Sign of Time will stumble directly into a ticking time-bomb--revealing that the whole session is literally running out of Time. They might also empower others by helping them to see how they can use their Time more wisely, or by finding more Time where nobody expected it to be.

### Knave/Damned - One who is cursed with [aspect]
The Knave and the Damned want to *escape* their aspect, and see their aspect as a curse of some form.

The Knave feels like their aspect is undeserved--they're competent, sure, and they benefit the team with their ability to wield that aspect in combat and otherwise, but they don't really *feel* like they should be using this aspect. As an Active class, the Knave's 'curse' always takes the form of some personal benefit, and they always feel like someone else would use it better. The Knave suffers from impostor syndrome, which is kinda funny, because *everyone* got their aspect powers for no real reason, but only the Knave seems to notice. They might sound similar to the Fiend, but where the Fiend gets their aspect as a gift, the Knave has it as some kind of weird inherent talent--which just plays into the impostor syndrome, because they didn't really *earn* it through training or practicing.

For example, a Knave of Light has been a lucky bastard since the day they were born, and they *hate* it. They just wanna be left alone, but with all this good luck, everyone always wants to be around them! If only you could trade classpects with someone.

The Damned feels like their aspect is the only part of them that anybody sees--they'd bring so much more to the team, if only everyone could see past this one part of them. As a Passive class, the Damned's curse is all about how the Damned affects others, and they always feel like everyone else is judging them at face value. The Damned suffers from being flanderized by their own friends, and struggle with finding real connections with others. Players who are stuck with the Damned class are particularly vulnerable to mental and emotional problems because of this, so be careful.

For example, a Damned of Joy really, *really* wishes people would take them seriously. Everyone thinks of them as the class clown, the wacky jokester who's always looking to tilt their Prankster's Gambit in a favorable direction. But doctor, they *are* Pagliacci…

### Priest/Seal - One who fights corruption through [aspect]
The Priest and the Seal focus on defeating "corruption" via their aspect, which in practice means they keep everyone in a healthy state of mind by applying what their aspect means.

The Priest treats their aspect like a sort of holy scripture, treating it as the best philosophy ever and extolling its virtues to anybody who'll listen. As an Active class, this usually manifests in confrontational ways--the Priest is the one you call in when you need an intervention. The frustrating-slash-handy thing is that the Priest understands their aspect in a really well-rounded way, and even Priests who are otherwise dumb as bricks can usually find some way to give good advice within the context of their aspect.

For example, a Priest of Blood will invoke family ties, loyalty, and the shared goals of the team to help someone realize that cooperation is important. Really handy when someone's going megalovaniac on you.

The Seal uses their aspect as a barrier, or like guide rails on a bowling alley--pushing others back to safety with their aspect. As a Passive class, this happens a lot more gently than you might think, and is basically a buff to everyone's mental wellbeing; the Seal is a fantastic therapist. Don't think too hard about the implications of mental health being something you can buff. The nice thing about this is that the Seal doesn't need to have dramatic interventions to make a difference--they provide the ounce of prevention that outweighs the pound of cure.

For example, a Seal of Hope can prevent someone from entering a critical depression spiral by showing them how to reject the despair they've become submerged in, protecting them with the power of Hope.

## Scamperway Classes
### Scout/Guide - One who explores the possibilities of [aspect]
The Scout and the Guide are all about finding neat stuff. Note that unlike the Sign, the stuff they find has always been there.

The Scout's deal is all about treasure hunting. They find their aspect in the wildest, most untamed places, and reap the benefits of seeing it within. These guys are like Steve Irwin or Indiana Jones; they take great joy in finding the most unusual things, and they see the beauty in every strange, remote place they've been to. Expect a Scout to run way ahead of everyone else, bypassing all the Weird Puzzle Shit somehow, and fail to bring back anything useful because they found a cool rock. But hey, they know where all the good shit is now.

For example, the Scout of Law will have a whole bunch of books on really dumb laws and rules, and will also spend all their time limit-testing and figuring out what the rules of the game are.

The Guide's deal is all about, well, guiding others. They know the lay of the land when it comes to their aspect, and they know exactly how to navigate by it. These guys are...kind of also like Steve Irwin, but mainly when he's on TV; they love sharing their knowledge, showing others what is safe and what isn't. Expect a Guide to patiently wait for you to catch up, because you won't be able to cross this part of their Land without them nudging you away from the pitfalls. Don't worry, they don't judge.

For example, the Guide of Flux is a fantastic storyteller, and also a fantastic director--patiently explaining to each actor what their role will be. Including yours. Remember, SBURB makes you more powerful if you're better at playing your role.

### Judge/Wheel - One whose [aspect] is justice
The Judge and the Wheel are two sides of the same coin--the coin of JUSTICE. And punishment. Hopefully mostly JUSTICE.

The Judge is, funnily enough, also jury and executioner. The Judge is like a paladin, wielding their aspect to SMITE the wicked. Whenever someone is doing evil, *especially* if it has to do with their aspect, the Judge will know and they'll bring the fist of god down upon that poor sucker's head. A Judge will eventually gain a more nuanced understanding of what justice is and what it means to bring judgement upon someone, but for the most part their primary concern is who to SMITE.

For example, the Judge of Rhyme knows when you fucked up your meter. You are never safe from the Judge of Rhyme and his immaculate sense of lyricism.

The Wheel is sworn to carry your burdens. The Wheel's got a cross to bear, and it's their aspect. Whenever someone is suffering, *especially* if it has to do with their aspect, the Wheel will end up carrying that suffering instead, whether they like it or not. It's like the universe conspires to make the Wheel the target of all bad omens. Over time, the Wheel grows stronger as they bear more bullshit, but that doesn't mean they're gonna be happy with being the designated doormat.

For example, the Wheel of Time is going to be better at scheduling than anybody else. To the point that basically the only reason you all can coordinate is because the Wheel of Time can handle your Time better than you can. Please thank your Wheel whenever you have a chance.

### Jack/Bride - One whose fate is [aspect]
The Jack and the Bride both have a date with destiny...and their aspect.

The Jack is perpetually running from that date with destiny. Their aspect feels like a chain around their neck, possibly because it is; it's their duty and destiny to be with their aspect, whether they like it or not. Don't ask the Jack about the wedding, 'cuz they have cold feet. The Jack's always looking for a chance to get away from their aspect, but--due to Wacky Hijinks--can still count on their aspect always being somewhere nearby.

For example, the Jack of Blades is always getting drawn into physical confrontations against their will; no matter how hard they try to be diplomatic, the solution always turns out to be stabby times.

The Bride is maybe a little too eager about that date with destiny. Their aspect feels like the most beautiful, most wonderful thing ever; it's their fate and destiny to be with their aspect, and they are very, very happy with this. Don't ask the Bride about the wedding, 'cuz they won't shut up. The Bride is always looking for a chance to commune with their aspect and share how wonderful it is, and--due to Wacky Hijinks--it's actually beneficial, despite being generally really weird.

For example, the Bride of Doom is...really morbid. Like, *concerningly* morbid. You know that one friend in high school who was obsessed with Nightmare Before Christmas? The Bride of Doom is even *more* into skeletons and stuff.

### Hand/Eye - One who coordinates [aspect]
Hand and Eye are the classes who can keep track of like a billion things.

The Hand has many, many irons in the fire, and is personally responsible for--and benefiting from--all of them. The Hand uses their aspect as an ace up their sleeve, a signature power, and a network of secret agents, all in one. Expect the Hand to have someting in place for everything, possibly including killing their fellow players if necessary. The Hand is a mob boss, always working an angle and always two steps ahead of the fuzz. (For some reason, the Hand of Void gains some incredibly bonkers powers, but Hand of Void players never seem to fully understand how good they have it--maybe because they become good at "coordinating nothing", i.e., are completely uncoordinated?)

For instance, the Hand of Cloaks has been quietly setting up a series of physics glitches that will launch a bathtub at mach 5 directly into this boss's face the moment the encounter starts.

The Eye has been watching over you since well before you were aware of it. The Eye uses their aspect as a way of keeping tabs on things, a spreadsheet and security network, all in one. Expect the Eye to already know about potential issues, and have a rough idea of where and how those issues might come up. The Eye is an accountant, always checking the numbers and always catching the details that other people miss.

For instance, the Eye of Coins is a more literal accountant, making sure everyone's gotten their fair share of good loot and buffing allies who are struggling to keep up with the grind.

## Brainitude Classes
### Gnome/Sylph - One who heals with [aspect]
The Gnome and the Sylph both use their aspect for extra survivability.

The Gnome is a bruiser, who can wield their aspect as a way of bolstering their own health. Gnomes are tough customers, competing with some Dame aspects for sheer ability to facetank things. Gnomes are particularly good at self-help, making them highly reliable, but they can also be stodgy individualists who don't see anything to gain from teamwork. After all, they can survive anything!

For example, a Gnome of Stone might literally give themselves stone skin, becoming nearly impervious to damage while slowly growing back anything that was missing.

The Sylph is the most support-focused passive class in the game. Their entire deal is supporting others; a Sylph is entirely defined by what they can do for their friends. Sylphs are always capable of some form of healing, which makes them extremely valuable in sessions that don't have a Life player--but the thing is, the Sylph *only* sees what they can do for others, and will feel very anxious if they're not doing *something* to help.

For example, a Sylph of Fae can duplicate the parts of you that might have gone missing due to a tragic case of being excessively stabbable, and will be sending dupliclones of themself to everyone to make *absolutely sure* that you're all doing okay.

### Sage/Seer - One who understands [aspect]
The Sage and the Seer are defined by their ability to make plans and understand their aspect on a deep strategic level.

The Sage is at least three steps ahead of everyone else. Whatever their aspect is, they are the single most powerful expert on that subject, and anything which might contest their brilliance is probably already part of their plan. The Sage has a million secrets, each of which will be revealed only when the time is right. In other words, don't expect the Sage to tell you anything, because the Sage *specifically* becomes more powerful if they know something nobody else does.

For instance, a Sage of Space has knowledge of such insane edge-cases and loopholes in the laws of physics that they can work a dozen miracles before breakfast. They won't tell you how they did it, though. Smug jerk.

The Seer is constantly on the lookout for strategic advantages. Their aspect is their domain of expertise, but unlike the Sage, the Seer is actually willing to *share* their insights. The Seer has a million theories, each of which is always being tested. In other words, they're probably sharing everything that's happened so far on GameFAQs, because the Seer *specifically* becomes more powerful the more their knowledge can be spread.

For instance, a Seer of Rage has been trying to figure out what's aggravating everyone, and is probably going to untangle some deep-seated trauma or personal vendetta that you didn't even know you had.

### Moon/Star - One whose [aspect] ebbs and flows
The Moon and the Star are all about timing and patterns, because their stuff works on a schedule.

The Moon grows stronger and weaker in a rhythm. Their aspect is in phases, changing in a cycle that can be predicted and taken advantage of. They can sort of control how fast that cycle moves, but they can't just turn it off, no more than you can turn off the tide. Being in sync with the Moon can be extremely valuable, but trying to force it will just frustrate everyone.

For example, the Moon of Moon will cycle between being perfectly sane--giving great insights--and becoming absolutely out of their mind. This means that the Moon of Moon will periodically do something stupid. Dammit, Moon of Moon.

The Star is in an elaborate celestial dance with everyone else. Their aspect is in orbit, with each of the other players passing in and out of its corona. They can predict when certain things will be in alignment, and when the stars *really* align, the Star will bring out the best in everyone--but the Star can't control what is in perihelion and aphelion, no more than you can move the sun.

For example, the Star of Stage will help the other players with their exits and their entrances, ensuring that everyone has their turn in the spotlight, and eventually bringing everyone together to take a bow.

### Soul/Monk - One whose [aspect] inspires humility
The Soul and the Monk bring other people down a peg with powerful displays of their aspect.

The Soul is the ultimate expression of their aspect, capable of feats of skill and talent that make superpowers look mundane. Unlike most classes, the Soul's powers are almost exclusively manifestations of personal skill, though that doesn't mean they're any less godly or miraculous. There is no such thing as 'going easy on you' for the Soul; they're always on, 24/7, and don't understand why anybody else would want to bring anything less than the A-game.

For example, the Soul of Flow spits bars so fire that it can melt faces. Their lyrical miracles are going to turn your brain inside out. The "top 10 rappers Eminem is afraid to diss" list is just ten copies of the Soul of Flow's face.

The Monk holds the power to reveal things of such beauty and simplicity that it can leave you speechless. The Monk, much like the Soul, is mostly manifesting godly skill rather than working miracles, but they still inspire (and buff) everyone around them in a miraculous way. There's no such thing as work for the Monk; they do this kind of awe-inspiring, earth-shattering work on a daily basis, and they see no reason to treat it as anything special.

For example, the Monk of Dream can create such incredible works of sculpture that even the Soul of Flow can't come up with anything to say about it.

# Aspect Triads
Each Aspect is placed within a themed Triad, and has some connection to the other two Aspects within that Triad.
Below is a table of Aspect Triads; you may randomly pick an Aspect by rolling 1d12 to pick a Triad, then rolling 1d3 to pick an Aspect from that Triad. Note that all valid sessions (i.e., not null) must have a Space and Time player. It is acceptable to reuse Aspects, but most sessions won't need to, since you only need to reuse Aspects if you have more than 36 players.

**The Chessboard and Billiards Triads are special; their Aspects cannot be obtained normally.**

| #  | Triad Name  | Aspects             |                    |                      |

## Aspect Descriptions
### Reality Triad
The Reality Triad deals with the fabric of reality itself.

Space is the aspect of...well, space. It deals with the physical presence and qualities of things, as well as their position within the world. They are, in particular, in charge of *creating more space*--via the breeding of the Genesis Frog. Creation in general is the apex of a Space player's power. Space players tend to be patient, and very good at big-picture thinking. The *Forge* always generates on the Space player's Land. Every valid Session has a Space player.

Time is the aspect of the passage of time, and the eternal struggle. It deals with the movement of things through time--both literally via time travel, and figuratively by fighting against the future as it hurtles toward you. Time players also have access to a special structure on their Land, which acts as a special "reset button" for the session, meant to be used as a last resort. Time players tend to be quick to act, and refuse to wait--Time waits for no man, after all. Every successful session has had a Time player.

Law is the aspect of regulation and rules. It deals with preventing things, ruling out the impossible, and setting reality in stone. Unlike the other two members of the Reality Triad, it is not strictly necessary to have a Law player in a successful session. Law players tend to be stubborn bastards, insisting on orderly, structured approaches, and quickly rejecting any plan that has minimal odds of success.

### Sapience Triad
The Sapience Triad deals with people, and what makes a person who they are.

Heart is the aspect of meaning, of the central point of one's existence. It deals with the "soul" of a thing--the essence of its being, summarized in the form of a glowy, sometimes heart-shaped object. Heart players have the unique ability to draw this "soul" out of any object, usually gaining its benefits in the process--as well as the ability to literally touch the "heart" of a thing to affect it deeply. Heart players tend to be self-confident, and also take great pains to maintain their self-image, seeking to embody what is in their own soul.

Mind is the aspect of decision-making and understanding. It deals with the choices that people can make, and the possibilities laid out by those things. Mind players are especially good at figuring out what *all* the possibilities are, and accounting for all of them at once. Mind players tend to be deeply concerned with making the *RIGHT* choice, which can leave them paralyzed with indecision when there are many, many options.

Self is the aspect of certainty and belief. It deals with the things that are given, the things that you will always know to be true. Self players have total confidence, not because they have carefully curated a self-image, but because they do not see any reason to question their own existence. Self players usually don't bother with explaining or planning things; the right choice seems obvious to them, so they take it.

### Emotion Triad
The Emotion Triad deals with...well, emotions.

Hope is the aspect of...Rejection? It sounds counterintuitive, but Hope is all about refusing to accept a bad outcome. The feeling of Hope is the feeling of knowing that there is a better way. Hope deals with facing impossible odds, not because you think you have a chance, but because the world MUST be better than this. Hope players struggle to just *accept* things, whether they're true or not.

Rage is the aspect of anger, frustration, fear, and doubt. Rage deals with grief, and hate, and anything that you don't particularly *want* to feel--but you have to feel them at *some* point, or else you're just in denial. Rage players care more about the truth than about what feels good, and they will fight like devils to tear down a lie. Rage players are the kind of friend that makes you wonder why you even hang out with them, until they bring a moment of clarity down on your head like a lead pipe to the soul, a reality check through the skull.

Joy is the aspect of laughter, but also of fear, and of redemption. How is fear connected to joy? Well, what else do you feel when you've escaped something terrifying? Joy is the reminder that you are alive, and that being alive is *worth it*. Joy deals with making the most of a bad situation, laughing in the face of danger, and celebrating what's left. A Joy player is always looking for an opportunity to crack a joke, especially when things look really bad.

### Body Triad
The Body Triad deals with the fundamental state of existing.

Breath is the aspect of impulsive decisions, of being wild, and of destruction. Breath is that little voice in the back of your mind that's always composing badass action scenes, because Breath wants to be DOING things. Breath deals with moving at full tilt, driving by the seat of your pants, reacting within a fraction of a second. Breath players are flexible, quick to react even when they aren't quick to act.

Blood is the aspect of focus, of steady progress, and of loyalty (to one's team, or one's mission). Blood is the part of you that will stick together to the end, because you're family. Blood deals with powering through things, seeing the oncoming threat and bracing for it, refusing to be stopped by a mere inconvenience. Blood players are driven, which is a polite way of saying they're stubborn jackasses.

Bone is the aspect of legacy--both the legacy of your ancestors and the legacy you'll leave behind. Bone is the part of you that knows you will die one day, and wants to leave something behind that'll last longer than your skeleton. Bone deals with permanence, leaving your mark on things, and being aware of what will eventually kill you. Bone players like to say 'memento mori' a lot, and they actually understand what it means; they're real 'fun' at parties, you know?

### Cycles Triad
The Cycles Triad deals with the cycle of death and rebirth.

Life is the aspect of living and growing. Life deals with being nurtured, with restoring things to their natural state; it is the tree that stretches toward the sky, sheltering hundreds or thousands of animals. Life players are always seeking to improve--which can mean finding a cure for what ails you...or experimenting with a new treatment that may or may not kill you. Oh well. Life players have a habit of being deeply selfless, even if it leaves them feeling personally left out of their own care.

Doom is the aspect of the ironclad and the inevitable: Death. There, I said it. You're gonna die, the rest of the players are gonna die, even the Life player is gonna die. It sucks, I know. Doom isn't the medicine that saves your life; it is the doctor who stands by your bedside, knowing that there is nothing he can do to save you, but staying there anyway because you deserve to be comforted in your final moments. Doom deals with things that were always going to happen, as well as the rules which govern them. Doom players don't judge, because death judges all things, but Doom players reserve the right to complain about how deeply fucking unfair the world can be.

Flesh is the aspect of stasis, preservation, and the undying. Who cares if death is inevitable? I'm a god! How can you kill a god? Flesh deals with making sure that nobody ever, *ever* leaves you. Flesh is the aspect which refuses to let go. If someone dies, just reanimate them! If someone's consciousness might disappear, just make it part of your own! Flesh players will *never* be alone again.

### Fortune Triad
The Fortune Triad deals with luck, outcomes, and twisting the odds in your favor.

Light is the aspect of good news. If you want a conflip to come up heads, hand the coin to the Light player. Light deals with the odds of success--and with having ALL of the luck (*all* of it). Light players are the best at finding the most fortuitous results. Light players *love* finding new information, and will eagerly share what they've learned--after all, knowledge is the greatest treasure of all.

Void is the aspect of . It deletes information, which makes it really hard to . Void deals with mystery, the unknown, and . Void players have a uniquely powerful (and terrifying) glitch which replaces one of their stats with . Void players don't mind at all when information is missing, which pisses me right off, because a Void player edited this paragraph and now it's full of .

Eyes is the aspect of illusions and trickery. Light players will flip the coin, call heads, and get it; Void players will make the coin's faces disappear and tell you it came up heads; Eyes makes the coin look like it has heads on both sides. Eyes deals with synesthesia, creating sensations where there are none. Eyes players never trust their first impression of something--they're intimately familiar with how easy it is to be fake.

### Songs Triad

The Songs Triad deals with laying down the universe's sickest bars.

Rhyme is the aspect of being the coldest mothafucka in the room. Rhyme deals with controlling intensity, making you stop, collaborate and listen. If you have a problem, the Rhyme player will solve it, and they'll make you wonder how the problem ever looked that big in the first place. Rhyme players can be as cold and disinterested as vanilla ice, which is really handy when you need to feel like something's not a big deal, but kind of annoying when something IS a big deal.

Flow is the aspect of spitting straight fire. Flow deals with moving faster, being the slickest there is--nay, even the slicky-wicky-wickest there is. When the going gets tough and you're getting bum-rushed, Flow will break out some crazy shit like a suitcase full of bees. It'll make you all like, wow, and then you'll be going 'wow' again. Like, *wow* wow. Flow players don't care if you're picking up what they're putting down, which can confuse the hell out of you if you're not ready for it.

Beat is the aspect of isolated, simple, straight-up *noise*. There's nothing that can faze a Beat player, because Beat deals with being self-sufficient, with having such mastery over the timing that you could be blind and deaf and still play this song perfectly. The drums are the backbone of any song, and you are the chiropractor. Beat players can come off as standoffish and rude, because they'd rather be practicing than making small talk.

### Taxes Triad
The Taxes Triad deals with wealth and power, and deciding where it goes.

Cups is the aspect of greed and power-grabs. Your cup runneth over, and you want your free refill, dammit. Cups deals with making sure that you've got everything and your enemies have nothing. There is never enough--and you deserve anything you can take. Anybody who's not strong enough to hold onto what they had deserves to be stolen from, anyway. Cups players are powergamers. They're also toxic as hell if they think someone on the team is 'wasting' something.

Coins is the aspect of fairness and balance. There are two sides to any coin, and those sides are split evenly; so too is the universe. Coins deals with dividing power fairly, ensuring everyone has their share--and having the self-control to accept that sometimes, you need to give some of your own power to those who need it. A well-balanced team is a successful team, and if you share the wealth, your allies will be strong enough to repay you in kind. In other words, Coins players are the kind of people who read Karl Marx for funsies.

Fate is the aspect of instinct, following directions, and letting the chips fall where they may. Truly understanding how power flows through the world is a task that no mortal being can truly accomplish. Fate deals with simply trusting that things will work out. Good things come to those who wait--more specifically, to those who are prepared. Like a surfer watching the waves, a Fate player is not expecting to be empowered--they're just ready for it. Fate players don't really see themselves as taking action; they're more just vibing with the universe in a way that *looks* like taking action, man.

### Combat Triad
The Combat Triad deals with the Gordian Knot of tactics.

Blades is the aspect of direct, overwhelming force. Tactics is ultimately just the application of force; with enough force, the problem of tactics is simplified to a single strike. Blades deals with subverting the subversion, with taking the obvious, simple approach instead of overthinking everything--it is the sword that cuts the knot. Blades players hate sitting around and discussing a plan, especially when that plan involves having to *hold back* for some stupid reason. What's a war crime?

Wands is the aspect of Weird Puzzle Shit and clever solutions. Tactics is a beautiful thing; with a strong enough sense of tactics, the problem of force can be turned against itself. Wands deals with outwitting one's foe, with taking exactly the right approach--it is the deft fingers which untie the knot. Wands players *need* to have a solid plan, and a plan B, and a plan C, and they don't like it when one of the other players skips the entire meeting to go get fried chicken.

Cloaks is the aspect of exploits and sequence breaks. Tactics is nice and all, and so is force, but the real power is in avoiding the problem entirely--with the right frame of reference, force and tactics become meaningless. Cloaks deals with outwitting the system itself and finding a third way--it's the sneaky bastard who stole the horse while you were waiting for him to untie it. Cloaks players don't quite understand why nobody else noticed the obviously-exploitable glitch they're relying on. This is a problem when the glitch's trigger conditions can range from "hump a specific wall at a specific angle" to "stab a fellow player and jump right before they slap you".

### Power Triad
The Power Triad deals with strength, in its various forms.

Flood is the aspect of continuity and unstoppable force. You cannot divert a flood, because the first wave has a thousand more waves behind it, all moving in unison. Flood deals with moving in unison, because true power comes from synchronized action. Flood players believe that they are invincible because they can wash away all who oppose them with unrelenting strikes. They tend to be really into kung-fu movies.

Sand is the aspect of weaknesses and structural failures. You cannot build a pillar out of sand, because the grains will always fall through your fingers. Sand deals with finding the place where bonds are weak, because true power comes from striking at exactly the right spot. Sand players believe they are invincible because they understand their own flaws perfectly. They're quick to call people out on their failures.

Stone is the aspect of endurance and the immovable object. You cannot destroy a stone, because even if you shatter it, all you've done is created two new stones. Stone deals with being nearly impossible to *truly* hurt, because true power comes from being so tough that your opponent exhausts himself before he can kill you. Stone players believe they are invincible because they *are* invincible. They don't see any reason to change just because you *asked* them to.

### Imagination Triad
The Imagination Triad deals with the mind, thoughts, and sanity.

Dream is the aspect of structured creativity, and the process of creating something. A mind is a machine for following and creating instructions. Dream deals with those instructions, producing grand creations by organizing their parts and feeding them through a mental factory. The things Dream creates are classically beautiful. Dream players do not like being interrupted when they're in The Zone.

Moon is the aspect of madness and rampancy. A mind is a wonderful thing to waste. Moon helps you waste it in such wonderful ways! Moon deals with making things topsy-turvy, helping you forget what bothers you and coming up with lovely replacements. Moon's creations make other people's heads start to hurt, but why should you care? You can see them just fine. Moon players are utterly bonkers, and their madness can spread into game constructs.

Fae is the aspect of replication and imitation. A mind is at its best when it can send copies of its thoughts to other minds. Fae deals with making it easier to copy your thoughts, particularly by copying you. Fae can also copy other things, of course. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and you can flatter with the best of them. Figuring out which Fae player is the *original* is a difficult task.

### Story Triad
The Story Triad deals with narratives and the legend of your life.

Stage is the aspect of constants, universal and otherwise. Your favorite book is the Hero's Journey, in all its forms. There's nothing new under the sun, and you know exactly how things are going to go! Stage deals with the rules of storytelling, understanding what will keep the audience hooked. Your legend will be great because it'll hit every beat right on cue. Stage players are the artiste--the kind of artiste who throws a fit if things don't go exactly according to their *vision*.

Ploy is the aspect of variables, smoke and mirrors, opposition and conflicts. Your favorite book is anything where there's an emotional, deeply dramatic showdown between two tragic figures. A great story is all about a compelling conflict, and you know exactly what the most exciting showdown would be! Ploy deals with playing forces against each other, keeping the audience guessing as to who will win. Your legend will be great because you'll beat the odds, probably with a fantastic speech as you rally for one last desperate strike against the final boss. Ploy players are schemers--they're always looking for a chance to set up some drama.

Flux is the aspect of unpredictability, because unpredictability is what makes a *really* interesting story. Your favorite book is the first book that ever really surprised you. A great story has to put a new twist on something, even if it's telling a tale that's as old as time, and you know just how to make this story new again! Flux deals with the unwritten rules of storytelling--particularly, the rule that there are no rules. Your legend will be great because you'll think outside of the box, and you know the box well enough to *truly* think outside of it. Flux players are wildcards--they do whatever makes the story more *interesting*. If you know anything about stories, you'll be scared of that word.
### Unaspectancy
Unaspectancies are *weird*. They don't function like normal Aspects. Instead of being tied to some metaphysical concept or philosophical approach, they're tied into deep, *deep* parts of the game, affecting game constructs in ways that no ordinary Aspect can--hence, "Unaspectancy", because they're Un-Aspects. Some veteran players theorize that Unaspectancies are actually developer tools that were left in the final build by mistake, like a dev console that you're not supposed to have access to. Needless to say, something needs to break really hard for you to have an Unaspectancy. 

These "aspects" are incredibly powerful, but also incredibly unstable--using them too much can cause some *very* bad things to happen. Most of the game is built around the assumption that you do things the *normal* way, with optimizations that break super hard when you use Unaspectancy to break the rules. The consequences for this can range from major inconveniences to making the session unwinnable.

Unaspectancies also don't work right with Classes--if you have an Unaspectancy, it won't fill out the [aspect] part of your Class's role, which can cause weird things to happen with the plot. For example, normally an Heir of [Aspect] will have quests that have to do with accepting the responsibility of their aspect--i.e., an Heir of Life has to accept the responsibility of others' lives being in their hands, an Heir of Blades has to accept responsibility for the repercussions of charging in swinging, and so on. If you're an Heir of Shades, your quests are about accepting the responsibility of ????. Your quests start glitching out, and might use other players' Aspects instead--or worse, they could be totally garbled messes that can't be completed normally. You'll have to figure something out. Good thing you have crazy OP aspect powers, right?

#### Chessboard Triad

Pale is the Aspect of the future, change, and revolution. Which is a fancy way of saying that it gives you the ability to change what things *will do*. It basically gives you a script editor, letting you alter the behavior of any object you can see. Unfortunately, there's limits--you can only attach behavior that already belonged to the object. You can't make a fridge start strifing for you, because it's a fridge; it can change temperatures and hold stuff. The good news is, you're free to make it do that stuff *any way you like*--you can make a fridge into a frosty deathtrap by making it open when imps are in front of it and freeze stuff to absolute zero when it's open, or turn it into an improvised oven by making it *heat* instead of *chill*. Even better, you can alchemize new stuff that has access to new behaviors--alchemize a robot with your fridge to make a Fridgebot, and now it *can* strife, because robots can strife. Just bear in mind that you're not necessarily a perfect programmer, even if you ARE better than SBURB's programmers. You are not immune to writing bugs into things…

Dim is the Aspect of the past and tradition. Which is a fancy way of saying that it lets you re-initialize things, resetting them to the way they were before. It basically gives you a reset button for all the different properties of an object, letting you send them back to where they were or set their stats back to the way they started. Be careful, because this *doesn't* give you an undo button--if you panic and reset a player, they might lose all their Echeladder rungs or everything in their Strife deck. And if you reset their *position*, they might get sent all the way back to the asteroid they rode in on--and you have *no idea* where that thing is...

Pied is the Aspect of the Battlefield, and other parts of the world. Which is a fancy way of saying that it can change the landscape, without having to spend grist or be near your house. It basically gives you the level editor, letting you alter any part of the game world as if you were your own server player, like a creative mode for SBURB. However, editing the game world *too* much can cause "desynchronization"--especially if you're editing things that aren't your house. See, SBURB is a networked game. SBURB expects the Lands to only change when quests are completed and stuff, so if you bore a hole to your Land's core and someone else visits, it'll look and act like solid ground to them. Weird Shit will happen as their reality goes out of sync with yours. Don't ask how *reality* can have client/server synchronization issues, you don't wanna know.

#### Billiard Triad

Shades is the Unaspectancy of creation. It has the ability to *create* things, including things that you'd otherwise be unable to create--duplicating your Kernelsprite, for instance, or making Grist out of thin air. You basically have access to a `/spawn` command. The thing is, this doesn't work quite right--things you `/spawn` don't get hooked into the normal processes for entities going about their business. This includes entity ID checks, which means that if you `/spawn` enough things, they start overwriting existing entities. The effects of this can range from "random items in your sylladex are now captchalogued grist(!?)" to "the imps you're fighting have their models replaced with invisible pumpkins".

Stripes is the Unaspectancy of destruction. It has the ability to *destroy* things, including things that are otherwise indestructible--erasing your Denizen, for instance (DO NOT DO THIS), or removing certain secret bosses from existence. You basically have access to a `/kill` command. The thing is, this doesn't work right either--things you `/kill` do not go through their normal death processing steps. This includes generating loot drops (meaning no grist), leaving a body behind, setting up the hooks for allowing resurrection, transferring a player to their dreamself, and so on--so you *REALLY* don't want to accidentally delete a player with this. In the long run, it gets even worse: entities that are `/kill`ed don't clean up their entity IDs, which means that the game thinks they're still alive...and still counting toward the spawn cap. In other words, if you `/kill` enough things on your Land, *things will stop spawning there*, meaning no Underlings to fight, no Consorts to talk to, and potentially no Denizen if you haven't met it yet.

Cues is the Unaspectancy of change. It has the ability to *change* things, including things that are otherwise impossible to change--directly editing your stats, for instance, or altering the properties of objects beyond what a Heart player can do. You basically have access to the "properties" window of everything you can see. The thing is, this doesn't operate on individual objects--you're not editing the properties of *this* rabbit plushie, you're editing the properties of every rabbit plushie in existence. This works fine if you're editing something unique, like another player, but if you're editing something that *isn't* unique you'll see a lot of knock-on effects. Even worse, this propagates through prototyping, in both directions--if you edit a wizard statue, and someone prototyped with a wizard statue, then all Underlings will take on new stats based on whatever you changed in that wizard statue. If you then edit an Underling to make it easier to fight, that edit reverse-propagates to *everything that Underling is prototyped with*. By the way, most Lands generate with a bunch of stuff that's related to what their players prototyped with, especially in Weird Puzzle Shit, so your edits will have wide-ranging repercussions on puzzles.
