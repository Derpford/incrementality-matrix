# Class Pairs
Each class is organized into pairs, each of which consists of an Active title and a Passive title. The details of what this means are complicated and not necessarily set in stone; this will be elaborated on in the description of each class.

# Aspect Triads
Each Aspect is placed within a themed Triad, and has some connection to the other two Aspects within that Triad.
Below is a table of Aspect Triads; you may randomly pick an Aspect by rolling 1d12 to pick a Triad, then rolling 1d3 to pick an Aspect from that Triad. Note that all valid sessions (i.e., not null) must have a Space and Time player. It is acceptable to reuse Aspects, but most sessions won't need to, since you only need to reuse Aspects if you have more than 36 players.

## Aspect Descriptions
### Reality Triad
The Reality Triad deals with the fabric of reality itself.

Space is the aspect of...well, space. It deals with the physical presence and qualities of things, as well as their position within the world. They are, in particular, in charge of *creating more space*--via the breeding of the Genesis Frog. Creation in general is the apex of a Space player's power. Space players tend to be patient, and very good at big-picture thinking. The *Forge* always generates on the Space player's Land. Every valid Session has a Space player.

Time is the aspect of the passage of time, and the eternal struggle. It deals with the movement of things through time--both literally via time travel, and figuratively by fighting against the future as it hurtles toward you. Time players also have access to a special structure on their Land, which acts as a special "reset button" for the session, meant to be used as a last resort. Time players tend to be quick to act, and refuse to wait--Time waits for no man, after all. Every successful session has had a Time player.

Law is the aspect of regulation and rules. It deals with preventing things, ruling out the impossible, and setting reality in stone. Unlike the other two members of the Reality Triad, it is not strictly necessary to have a Law player in a successful session. Law players tend to be stubborn bastards, insisting on orderly, structured approaches, and quickly rejecting any plan that has minimal odds of success.

### Sapience Triad
The Sapience Triad deals with people, and what makes a person who they are.

Heart is the aspect of meaning, of the central point of one's existence. It deals with the "soul" of a thing--the essence of its being, summarized in the form of a glowy, sometimes heart-shaped object. Heart players have the unique ability to draw this "soul" out of any object, usually gaining its benefits in the process--as well as the ability to literally touch the "heart" of a thing to affect it deeply. Heart players tend to be self-confident, and also take great pains to maintain their self-image, seeking to embody what is in their own soul.

Mind is the aspect of decision-making and understanding. It deals with the choices that people can make, and the possibilities laid out by those things. Mind players are especially good at figuring out what *all* the possibilities are, and accounting for all of them at once. Mind players tend to be deeply concerned with making the *RIGHT* choice, which can leave them paralyzed with indecision when there are many, many options.

Self is the aspect of certainty and belief. It deals with the things that are given, the things that you will always know to be true. Self players have total confidence, not because they have carefully curated a self-image, but because they do not see any reason to question their own existence. Self players usually don't bother with explaining or planning things; the right choice seems obvious to them, so they take it.

### Emotion Triad
The Emotion Triad deals with...well, emotions.

Hope is the aspect of...Rejection? It sounds counterintuitive, but Hope is all about refusing to accept a bad outcome. The feeling of Hope is the feeling of knowing that there is a better way. Hope deals with facing impossible odds, not because you think you have a chance, but because the world MUST be better than this. Hope players struggle to just *accept* things, whether they're true or not.

Rage is the aspect of anger, frustration, fear, and doubt. Rage deals with grief, and hate, and anything that you don't particularly *want* to feel--but you have to feel them at *some* point, or else you're just in denial. Rage players care more about the truth than about what feels good, and they will fight like devils to tear down a lie. Rage players are the kind of friend that makes you wonder why you even hang out with them, until they bring a moment of clarity down on your head like a lead pipe to the soul, a reality check through the skull.

Joy is the aspect of laughter, but also of fear, and of redemption. How is fear connected to joy? Well, what else do you feel when you've escaped something terrifying? Joy is the reminder that you are alive, and that being alive is *worth it*. Joy deals with making the most of a bad situation, laughing in the face of danger, and celebrating what's left. A Joy player is always looking for an opportunity to crack a joke, especially when things look really bad.

### Body Triad
The Body Triad deals with the fundamental state of existing.

Breath is the aspect of impulsive decisions, of being wild, and of destruction. Breath is that little voice in the back of your mind that's always composing badass action scenes, because Breath wants to be DOING things. Breath deals with moving at full tilt, driving by the seat of your pants, reacting within a fraction of a second. Breath players are flexible, quick to react even when they aren't quick to act.

Blood is the aspect of focus, of steady progress, and of loyalty (to one's team, or one's mission). Blood is the part of you that will stick together to the end, because you're family. Blood deals with powering through things, seeing the oncoming threat and bracing for it, refusing to be stopped by a mere inconvenience. Blood players are driven, which is a polite way of saying they're stubborn jackasses.

Bone is the aspect of legacy--both the legacy of your ancestors and the legacy you'll leave behind. Bone is the part of you that knows you will die one day, and wants to leave something behind that'll last longer than your skeleton. Bone deals with permanence, leaving your mark on things, and being aware of what will eventually kill you. Bone players like to say 'memento mori' a lot, and they actually understand what it means; they're real 'fun' at parties, you know?

### Cycles Triad
The Cycles Triad deals with the cycle of death and rebirth.

Life is the aspect of living and growing. Life deals with being nurtured, with restoring things to their natural state; it is the tree that stretches toward the sky, sheltering hundreds or thousands of animals. Life players are always seeking to improve--which can mean finding a cure for what ails you...or experimenting with a new treatment that may or may not kill you. Oh well. Life players have a habit of being deeply selfless, even if it leaves them feeling personally left out of their own care.

Doom is the aspect of the ironclad and the inevitable: Death. There, I said it. You're gonna die, the rest of the players are gonna die, even the Life player is gonna die. It sucks, I know. Doom isn't the medicine that saves your life; it is the doctor who stands by your bedside, knowing that there is nothing he can do to save you, but staying there anyway because you deserve to be comforted in your final moments. Doom deals with things that were always going to happen, as well as the rules which govern them. Doom players don't judge, because death judges all things, but Doom players reserve the right to complain about how deeply fucking unfair the world can be.

Flesh is the aspect of stasis, preservation, and the undying. Who cares if death is inevitable? I'm a god! How can you kill a god? Flesh deals with making sure that nobody ever, *ever* leaves you. Flesh is the aspect which refuses to let go. If someone dies, just reanimate them! If someone's consciousness might disappear, just make it part of your own! Flesh players will *never* be alone again.

### Fortune Triad
The Fortune Triad deals with luck, outcomes, and twisting the odds in your favor.

Light is the aspect of good news. If you want a conflip to come up heads, hand the coin to the Light player. Light deals with the odds of success--and with having ALL of the luck (*all* of it). Light players are the best at finding the most fortuitous results. Light players *love* finding new information, and will eagerly share what they've learned--after all, knowledge is the greatest treasure of all.

Void is the aspect of . It deletes information, which makes it really hard to . Void deals with mystery, the unknown, and . Void players have a uniquely powerful (and terrifying) glitch which replaces one of their stats with . Void players don't mind at all when information is missing, which pisses me right off, because a Void player edited this paragraph and now it's full of .

Vision is the aspect of illusions and trickery. Light players will flip the coin, call heads, and get it; Void players will make the coin's faces disappear and tell you it came up heads; Vision makes the coin look like it has heads on both sides. Vision deals with synesthesia, creating sensations where there are none. Vision players never trust their first impression of something--they're intimately familiar with how easy it is to be fake.

### Songs Triad

The Songs Triad deals with laying down the universe's sickest bars.

Rhyme is the aspect of being the coldest mothafucka in the room. Rhyme deals with controlling intensity, making you stop, collaborate and listen. If you have a problem, the Rhyme player will solve it, and they'll make you wonder how the problem ever looked that big in the first place. Rhyme players can be as cold and disinterested as vanilla ice, which is really handy when you need to feel like something's not a big deal, but kind of annoying when something IS a big deal.

Flow is the aspect of spitting straight fire. Flow deals with moving faster, being the slickest there is--nay, even the slicky-wicky-wickest there is. When the going gets tough and you're getting bum-rushed, Flow will break out some crazy shit like a suitcase full of bees. It'll make you all like, wow, and then you'll be going 'wow' again. Like, *wow* wow. Flow players don't care if you're picking up what they're putting down, which can confuse the hell out of you if you're not ready for it.

Beat is the aspect of isolated, simple, straight-up *noise*. There's nothing that can faze a Beat player, because Beat deals with being self-sufficient, with having such mastery over the timing that you could be blind and deaf and still play this song perfectly. The drums are the backbone of any song, and you are the chiropractor. Beat players can come off as standoffish and rude, because they'd rather be practicing than making small talk.

### Taxes Triad
The Taxes Triad deals with wealth and power, and deciding where it goes.

Cups is the aspect of greed and power-grabs. Your cup runneth over, and you want your free refill, dammit. Cups deals with making sure that you've got everything and your enemies have nothing. There is never enough--and you deserve anything you can take. Anybody who's not strong enough to hold onto what they had deserves to be stolen from, anyway. Cups players are powergamers. They're also toxic as hell if they think someone on the team is 'wasting' something.

Coins is the aspect of fairness and balance. There are two sides to any coin, and those sides are split evenly; so too is the universe. Coins deals with dividing power fairly, ensuring everyone has their share--and having the self-control to accept that sometimes, you need to give some of your own power to those who need it. A well-balanced team is a successful team, and if you share the wealth, your allies will be strong enough to repay you in kind. In other words, Coins players are the kind of people who read Karl Marx for funsies.

Fate is the aspect of instinct, following directions, and letting the chips fall where they may. Truly understanding how power flows through the world is a task that no mortal being can truly accomplish. Fate deals with simply trusting that things will work out. Good things come to those who wait--more specifically, to those who are prepared. Like a surfer watching the waves, a Fate player is not expecting to be empowered--they're just ready for it. Fate players don't really see themselves as taking action; they're more just vibing with the universe in a way that *looks* like taking action, man.

### Combat Triad
The Combat Triad deals with the Gordian Knot of tactics.

Blades is the aspect of direct, overwhelming force. Tactics is ultimately just the application of force; with enough force, the problem of tactics is simplified to a single strike. Blades deals with subverting the subversion, with taking the obvious, simple approach instead of overthinking everything--it is the sword that cuts the knot. Blades players hate sitting around and discussing a plan, especially when that plan involves having to *hold back* for some stupid reason. What's a war crime?

Wands is the aspect of Weird Puzzle Shit and clever solutions. Tactics is a beautiful thing; with a strong enough sense of tactics, the problem of force can be turned against itself. Wands deals with outwitting one's foe, with taking exactly the right approach--it is the deft fingers which untie the knot. Wands players *need* to have a solid plan, and a plan B, and a plan C, and they don't like it when one of the other players skips the entire meeting to go get fried chicken.

Cloaks is the aspect of exploits and sequence breaks. Tactics is nice and all, and so is force, but the real power is in avoiding the problem entirely--with the right frame of reference, force and tactics become meaningless. Cloaks deals with outwitting the system itself and finding a third way--it's the sneaky bastard who stole the horse while you were waiting for him to untie it. Cloaks players don't quite understand why nobody else noticed the obviously-exploitable glitch they're relying on. This is a problem when the glitch's trigger conditions can range from "hump a specific wall at a specific angle" to "stab a fellow player and jump right before they slap you".

### Power Triad
The Power Triad deals with strength, in its various forms.

Flood is the aspect of continuity and unstoppable force. You cannot divert a flood, because the first wave has a thousand more waves behind it, all moving in unison. Flood deals with moving in unison, because true power comes from synchronized action. Flood players believe that they are invincible because they can wash away all who oppose them with unrelenting strikes. They tend to be really into kung-fu movies.

Sand is the aspect of weaknesses and structural failures. You cannot build a pillar out of sand, because the grains will always fall through your fingers. Sand deals with finding the place where bonds are weak, because true power comes from striking at exactly the right spot. Sand players believe they are invincible because they understand their own flaws perfectly. They're quick to call people out on their failures.

Stone is the aspect of endurance and the immovable object. You cannot destroy a stone, because even if you shatter it, all you've done is created two new stones. Stone deals with being nearly impossible to *truly* hurt, because true power comes from being so tough that your opponent exhausts himself before he can kill you. Stone players believe they are invincible because they *are* invincible. They don't see any reason to change just because you *asked* them to.

### Imagination Triad
The Imagination Triad deals with the mind, thoughts, and sanity.

Dream is the aspect of structured creativity, and the process of creating something. A mind is a machine for following and creating instructions. Dream deals with those instructions, producing grand creations by organizing their parts and feeding them through a mental factory. The things Dream creates are classically beautiful. Dream players do not like being interrupted when they're in The Zone.

Moon is the aspect of madness and rampancy. A mind is a wonderful thing to waste. Moon helps you waste it in such wonderful ways! Moon deals with making things topsy-turvy, helping you forget what bothers you and coming up with lovely replacements. Moon's creations make other people's heads start to hurt, but why should you care? You can see them just fine. Moon players are utterly bonkers, and their madness can spread into game constructs.

Fae is the aspect of replication and imitation. A mind is at its best when it can send copies of its thoughts to other minds. Fae deals with making it easier to copy your thoughts, particularly by copying you. Fae can also copy other things, of course. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and you can flatter with the best of them. Figuring out which Fae player is the *original* is a difficult task.

### Story Triad
The Story Triad deals with narratives and the legend of your life.

Stage is the aspect of constants, universal and otherwise. Your favorite book is the Hero's Journey, in all its forms. There's nothing new under the sun, and you know exactly how things are going to go! Stage deals with the rules of storytelling, understanding what will keep the audience hooked. Your legend will be great because it'll hit every beat right on cue. Stage players are the artiste--the kind of artiste who throws a fit if things don't go exactly according to their *vision*.

Ploy is the aspect of variables, smoke and mirrors, opposition and conflicts. Your favorite book is anything where there's an emotional, deeply dramatic showdown between two tragic figures. A great story is all about a compelling conflict, and you know exactly what the most exciting showdown would be! Ploy deals with playing forces against each other, keeping the audience guessing as to who will win. Your legend will be great because you'll beat the odds, probably with a fantastic speech as you rally for one last desperate strike against the final boss. Ploy players are schemers--they're always looking for a chance to set up some drama.

Flux is the aspect of unpredictability, because unpredictability is what makes a *really* interesting story. Your favorite book is the first book that ever really surprised you. A great story has to put a new twist on something, even if it's telling a tale that's as old as time, and you know just how to make this story new again! Flux deals with the unwritten rules of storytelling--particularly, the rule that there are no rules. Your legend will be great because you'll think outside of the box, and you know the box well enough to *truly* think outside of it. Flux players are wildcards--they do whatever makes the story more *interesting*. If you know anything about stories, you'll be scared of that word.
